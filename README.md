~~open ai compatible url that uses t3.chat api for responses.~~

~~uses your browser cookie (can be obtained by looking at the request in dev tools when u use t3.chat)~~

~~shouldnt be against any tos like t3.chat or whatever since it still takes up 1 message from ur monthly usage every api call.~~

~~this is tested with a pro t3.chat account, likely won't let you use models that a free t3.chat account won't let you use (if you use a free account's cookie.)~~

~~- [x] basic /v1/chat/completions endpoint~~
~~- [ ] built in tool usage (like in open ai's api)~~
       
~~some software that use open ai compatible urls manage tools via the open ai api itself and some do tool usage manually via telling it to use xml tags etc.~~
~~the tool part of open ai's api is not in this currently.~~
i dont think this works anymore cuz theo changed his cookie stuff
