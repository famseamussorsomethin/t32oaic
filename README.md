open ai compatible url that uses t3.chat api for responses.

uses your browser cookie (can be obtained by looking at the request in dev tools when u use t3.chat)

shouldnt be against any tos like t3.chat or whatever since it still takes up 1 message from ur monthly usage every api call.

this is tested with a pro t3.chat account, likely won't let you use models that a free t3.chat account won't let you use (if you use a free account's cookie.)

 - [x] basic /v1/chat/completions endpoint
 - [ ] built in tool usage (like in open ai's api)
       
some software that use open ai compatible urls manage tools via the open ai api itself and some do tool usage manually via telling it to use xml tags etc. 
the tool part of open ai's api is not in this currently.
