open ai compatible url that uses t3.chat api for responses.

uses your browser cookie (can be obtained by looking at the request in dev tools when u use t3.chat)

shouldnt be against any tos like t3.chat or whatever since it still takes up 1 message from ur monthly usage.

 - [x] basic /v1/chat/completions endpoint
 - [ ] other stuff...
unsure:
tool call usage, some things that use open ai compatible urls do tools via the open ai thing but some just do xml tags so yeah.
